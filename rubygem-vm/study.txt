If you have no network connection or are behind a very restrictive firewall you may find it difficult to install gems.

Downloading and installing gems

Here is how you work around this problem, provided you have an alternate way of moving the files.
Install the gems on an internet-connected computer to a temporary directory. Since we're only interested in the files, also disable documentation generation:

$ gem install rails -i repo --no-rdoc --no-ri
RubyGems has downloaded all the .gem files and placed them in gems/cache. Copy this directory to a USB drive or use a secure network to transfer it:

$ cp -r repo/cache /path/to/USB_drive/gems
Install the gems on the destination machine from the local files:

$ cd /path/to/USB_drive/gems
$ gem install --force --local *.gem
